# Client (Vite + React)

This folder contains a Vite + React client scaffold for migrating the static portfolio into an SPA.

Quick start (from repo root):

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- I intentionally created this under `client/` so your original site files remain untouched.
- Next steps: migrate HTML pages into `src/pages/` and copy CSS/images into `src/assets/` or `public/`.
